the mistake bound model to online multiclass classification.
In the {\em standard model}, the learner receives the
correct classification at the end of each round, and
in the {\em bandit model}, the learner only finds out whether
its prediction was correct or not.  For a set $F$ of multiclass
classifiers, let $\mathrm{opt}_{\mathrm{std}}(F)$ and $\mathrm{opt}_{\mathrm{bandit}}(F)$ be the optimal bounds
for learning $F$ according to these two models.  We show that an

Building upon recent work of Chaudhuri and Dasgupta we prove that these minimax rates are attained by the approximate nearest neighbour algorithm, where neighbours are computed in a randomly projected low-dimensional space.

an unknown  probability distribution over the space of all one-way infinite sequences.
It is known that this measure belongs to a given set $\mathcal{C}$, but the latter is completely arbitrary 
(uncountably infinite, without any structure given).  The performance is measured 
by  asymptotic average log loss.  In this work it is shown that the minimax asymptotic
performance  is always attainable, and it is attained by a Bayesian mixture over countably many 
measures from the set $\mathcal{C}$. This was previously only known for the case when the best achievable asymptotic error is~0. The new result can  be interpreted  as a complete-class theorem for prediction. 
It also contrasts previous results that show that in the non-realizable case all Bayesian mixtures may be suboptimal.
 This leads to a very general conclusion concerning model selection for a problem of sequential inference: it is better to take a model large enough to make sure it includes the process that generates the data, even if it entails positive asymptotic average loss, for otherwise any combination of predictors in the model

    abstract = {Pattern languages have been an object of study in various subfields of computer science for decades. This paper introduces and studies a decision problem on patterns called the \emph{finite distinguishability} problem: given a pattern $\pi$, are there finite sets $T^+$ and $T^-$ of strings such that the only pattern language containing all strings in $T^+$ and none of the strings in $T^-$ is the language generated by $\pi$? This problem is related to the complexity of teacher-directed learning, as studied in computational learning theory, as well as to the long-standing open question whether the equivalence of two patterns is decidable. We show that finite distinguishability is decidable if the underlying alphabet is of size other than $2$ or $3$, and provide a number of related results, such as (i) partial solutions for alphabet sizes $2$ and $3$, and (ii) decidability proofs for variants of the problem for special subclasses of patterns, namely, regular, 1-variable, and non-cross patterns. For the same subclasses, we further determine the values of two complexity parameters in teacher-directed learning, namely the \emph{teaching dimension}\/ and the \emph{recursive teaching dimension}.}

The property that is sufficient and necessary for a unique decoding is the separability of the tests, but unfortunately no linear time algorithm is known for such tests. In order to achieve linear-time decodable tests, the algorithms in the literature use the disjunction property that gives almost optimal number of tests.

We define a new property for the tests which we call semi-disjunction property. We show that there is a linear time decoding for such test and for $d\to \infty$ the number of tests converges to the number of tests with the separability property. Our analysis shows that, in the RID model, the number of tests in our algorithm is better than the one with the disjunction property even for small $d$.}

We study a variant of \textit{boundary crossing probabilities} coming from

Formally, our result is a concentration inequality that bounds the probability that $\mathcal{B}^\psi(\hat \theta_n,\theta^\star)\geq f(t/n)/n$, where $\theta^\star$ is the parameter of an unknown target distribution,
$\hat \theta_n$ is the empirical parameter estimate built from $n$ observations, $\psi$ is the log-partition function of the exponential family and $\mathcal{B}^\psi$ is the corresponding Bregman divergence. From the perspective of stochastic multi-armed bandits, we pay special attention to the case when the boundary function $f$ is logarithmic, as it enables to analyze the regret of the state-of-the-art {\texttt{KL-ucb}}\ and {\texttt{KL-ucb+}}\ strategies, whose analysis was left open in such generality. Indeed, previous results only hold for the case when $K=1$,
while we provide results for arbitrary finite dimension $K$, thus considerably extending the existing results.
Perhaps surprisingly, we highlight that the proof techniques to achieve these strong results  already  existed three decades ago in the work of T.L. Lai, and were apparently forgotten in the bandit community. We provide a modern rewriting of these beautiful techniques that we believe are useful beyond the application to stochastic multi-armed bandits.}

It is known that if $f$ depends on all its variables, then the set of its extremal points completely specifies $f$ within the universe 
of threshold functions. However, in some cases, $f$ can be specified by a smaller set. The minimum number of 
points in such a set is the specification number of $f$. 
Hu~(1965) showed that the specification number of a threshold function of $n$ variables is at least $n+1$.  
Anthony et al.~(1995) proved that this bound is attained for nested functions and conjectured that for all other threshold functions the specification
number is strictly greater than $n+1$. In the present paper, we resolve this conjecture negatively by 
exhibiting threshold Boolean functions of $n$ variables, which are non-nested and 
for which the specification number is $n+1$. On the other hand, we show that the set of extremal points satisfies 
the statement of the conjecture, i.e.~a positive threshold Boolean function depending on all its $n$ variables has $n+1$ extremal points if and only if
it is nested. To prove this, we reveal an underlying structure of the set of extremal points.}

The graphs are connected, unweighted and have bounded maximum degree $\Delta$. The task of the graph verification problem is to verify that $E=\hat{E}$. We have access to $G$ through a black-box betweenness oracle. A betweenness oracle returns whether a vertex lies along a shortest path between two other vertices. The betweenness oracle nicely captures many real-world problems. We prove that graph verification can be done using $n^{1+o(1)}$ betweenness queries. Surprisingly, this matches the state of the art for the graph verification problem with the much stronger distance oracle. We also prove that graph verification requires $\Omega(n)$ betweenness queries -- a matching lower bound.}

and moreover use information from these tasks to improve their ability to do so efficiently.
 In this work, our goal is to provide new theoretical insights into the potential of this paradigm. In particular, we propose a lifelong learning framework that adheres to a novel notion of resource efficiency that is critical in many real-world domains where feature evaluations are costly. That is, our learner aims to reuse information from previously learned related tasks to learn future tasks in a {\em feature-efficient} manner. 
Furthermore, we consider novel combinatorial ways in which learning tasks can relate.  Specifically, we design lifelong learning algorithms
for two structurally different and widely used families of target functions: decision trees/lists and monomials/polynomials.
We also provide strong feature-efficiency guarantees for these algorithms; in fact, we show that in order to learn future targets, we need only slightly more feature evaluations per training example than what is needed to predict on an arbitrary example using those targets.
We also provide algorithms with guarantees in an 
 agnostic model where not all the targets are related to each other. Finally, we also provide lower bounds on the performance of a lifelong learner in these models, which are in fact tight under some conditions.}

The latter are also clustered, and each user rates a random but typical small number of items. The observed ratings are random variables whose distributions depend on the item and user clusters only. Unlike for collaborative filtering problems where one needs to recover both user and item clusters, here we only wish to classify items. The number of items rated by a user can be so small that anyway, estimating user clusters may be hopeless. For the collaborative clustering problem, we derive fundamental performance limits satisfied by any algorithm. Specifically, we identify the number of ratings needed to guarantee the existence of an algorithm recovering the clusters with a prescribed level of accuracy. We also propose {\sf SplitSpec}, an algorithm whose performance matches these fundamental performance limit order-wise. In turn, {\sf SplitSpec} is able to exploit, as much as this is possible, the users' structure to improve the item cluster estimates.}

Obtaining and estimating choice probabilities for such large assortments is not desirable in many settings.

invariants are naturally expressed with respect to group operations, and thus
an understanding of these groups is key to explaining the effectiveness of the
neural network. Moreover, a line of work in deep learning has shown that
explicit knowledge of group invariants can lead to more effective training
results. 


In this paper, we investigate the difficulty of
discovering anything about these implicit invariants. Unfortunately, our main results are
negative: we show that a variety of questions around investigating invariant
representations are NP-hard, even in approximate settings. Moreover, these
results do not depend on the kind of architecture used: in fact, our results
follow as soon as the network architecture is powerful enough to be
universal. The key idea behind our results is that if we can find the symmetries

which the individual coordinates (features) can be arbitrarily rescaled. 
We give an algorithm, which achieves essentially optimal regret bound in this

comparator. We then study general invariance with respect to
arbitrary linear transformations. 
We first give a negative result, showing that
no algorithm can achieve a meaningful bound in terms of scale-invariant norm of
the comparator in the worst case. Next, we compliment this result with a
positive one, providing an algorithm which ``almost'' achieves the desired bound,

When the conditions are satisfied the alternating minimization is guaranteed to converge to the global minimum of the bound.

These normal forms support and simplify proofs and give insight into what behaviors are necessary for successful learning (for example when consistency in conservative learning implies cautiousness and strong decisiveness).
	
	We show that strongly locking learning can be assumed for partially set-driven learners, even when learning restrictions apply. We give a very general proof relying only on a natural property of the learning restriction, namely, allowing for simulation on equivalent text. Furthermore, when no restrictions apply, also the converse is true: every strongly locking learner can be made partially set-driven.

As often in prediction with expert advice, designing an algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret guarantees is straightforward, using aggregation of experts.
However, when the comparison class is sufficiently rich, for instance when the best expert and the set of experts itself changes over time, such strategies naively require to maintain a prohibitive number of weights (typically exponential with the time horizon).
By contrast, designing strategies that both achieve a near-optimal regret and maintain a reasonable number of weights is highly non-trivial.
We consider three increasingly challenging objectives (simple regret, shifting regret and sparse shifting regret) that extend existing notions defined for a fixed expert ensemble;
in each case, we design strategies that achieve tight regret bounds, adaptive to the parameters of the comparison class, while being computationally inexpensive.
Moreover, our algorithms are anytime, agnostic to the number of incoming experts and completely parameter-free.
Such remarkable results are made possible thanks to two simple but highly effective recipes: first the ``abstention trick'' that comes from the \emph{specialist} framework and enables to handle the least challenging notions of regret, but is limited when addressing more sophisticated objectives.
Second, the ``muting trick'' that we introduce to give more flexibility. We show how to combine these two tricks in order to handle the most challenging class of comparison strategies.}

Informally, a function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is self-bounding if for every $x \in \{0,1\}^n$, $f(x)$ upper bounds the sum of all the $n$ marginal decreases in the value of the function at $x$. Self-bounding functions include such well-known classes of functions as submodular and fractionally-subadditive (XOS) functions. They were introduced by Boucheron \textit{et al.}~in the context of concentration of measure inequalities. 
Our main result is a  nearly tight $\ell_1$-approximation of self-bounding functions by low-degree juntas. Specifically, all self-bounding functions can be $\epsilon$-approximated in $\ell_1$ by a polynomial of degree $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)$ over $2^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)}$ variables. We show that both the degree and junta-size are optimal up to logarithmic terms. Previous techniques considered stronger $\ell_2$ approximation and proved nearly tight bounds of  $\Theta(1/\epsilon^{2})$ on the degree and $2^{\Theta(1/\epsilon^2)}$ on the number of variables. Our bounds rely on the analysis of noise stability of self-bounding functions together with a stronger connection between noise stability and $\ell_1$ approximation by low-degree polynomials. This technique can also be used to get tighter bounds on $\ell_1$ approximation by low-degree polynomials and faster learning algorithm for halfspaces.

These results lead to improved and in several cases almost tight bounds for PAC and agnostic learning of self-bounding functions relative to the uniform distribution. In particular, assuming hardness of learning juntas, we show that PAC and agnostic learning of self-bounding functions have complexity of $n^{\tilde{\Theta}(1/\epsilon)}$.}

many applications from sensor placement to active learning. In the 
current paper, we extend this work to the setting of multiple queries at 
each time step, where the set of available queries is randomly constrained. 
A primary contribution of this paper is to prove the first near optimal 
approximation bound for a greedy policy in this setting. 
A natural application of this framework is to crowd-sourced active learning  
problem where the set of available experts and examples might vary randomly. 
We instantiate 
the new framework for multi-label learning and evaluate it in multiple 
benchmark domains with promising results.}

    abstract = {We study the problem of identifying the best action among a set of possible options 
when the value of each action is given by a mapping from a number of noisy micro-observables in the so-called fixed confidence setting.
Our main motivation is the application to minimax game search, which has been a major topic of interest in artificial intelligence.
In this paper we introduce an abstract setting to clearly describe the essential properties of the problem.
While previous work only considered a two-move-deep game tree search problem,
our abstract setting can be applied to the general minimax games where the depth can be non-uniform and arbitrary, and transpositions are allowed.
We introduce a new algorithm (LUCB-micro) for the abstract setting, and give its lower and upper sample complexity results. 
Our bounds recover some previous results, achieved in more limited settings, and also shed further light on how the structure of minimax problems influences sample complexity.}

    title = {On Compressive Ensemble Induced Regularisation: How Close is the Finite Ensemble Precision Matrix to the Infinite Ensemble?},
    author = {Ata Kab\'an},
    pages = {617-628},
    abstract = {Averaging ensembles of randomly oriented low-dimensional projections of a singular covariance represent a novel and attractive means to obtain a well-conditioned inverse, which only needs access to random projections of the data. However, theoretical analyses so far have only been done at convergence, implying good properties for `large-enough' ensembles. But how large is `large enough'? Here we bound the expected difference in spectral norm between the finite ensemble precision matrix and the infinite ensemble, and based on this we give an estimate of the required ensemble size to guarantee the approximation error of the finite ensemble is below a given tolerance.
Under mild assumptions, we find that for any given tolerance, the ensemble only needs to grow linearly in the original data dimension. 
A technical ingredient of our analysis is to upper bound the spectral norm of a matrix-variate T,  which we then  employ in conjunction with specific results from random matrix theory regarding the estimation of the covariance of random matrices.}

    title = {Dealing with Range Anxiety in Mean Estimation via Statistical Queries},
    author = {Vitaly Feldman},
    pages = {629-640},
    abstract = {We give algorithms for estimating the expectation of a given real-valued function $\phi:X\to \mathbb{R}$ on a sample drawn randomly from some unknown distribution $D$ over domain $X$, namely $\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D}[\phi(\mathbf{x})]$. Our algorithms work in two well-studied models of restricted access to data samples. The first one is the statistical query (SQ) model in which an algorithm has access to an {\em SQ oracle} for the input distribution $D$ over $X$ instead of i.i.d.~samples from $D$. Given a query function $\phi:X \to [0,1]$, the oracle returns an estimate of $\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D}[\phi(\mathbf{x})]$ within some tolerance $\tau$. The second, is a  model in which only a single bit is communicated from each sample. In both of these models the error obtained using a naive implementation would scale polynomially with the range of the random variable $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ (which might even be infinite). In contrast, without restrictions on access to data the expected error scales with the standard deviation of $\phi(\mathbf{x})$. Here we give a simple algorithm whose error scales linearly in standard deviation of $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ and logarithmically with an upper bound on the second moment of $\phi(\mathbf{x})$.

As corollaries, we obtain algorithms for high dimensional mean estimation and stochastic convex optimization in these models that work in more general settings than previously known solutions.}

    pages = {641-666},
    abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms are based on the assumption that training examples are drawn independently. 
However, this assumption does not hold anymore when learning from a networked sample because two or more training examples may share some common objects, 
and hence share the features of these shared objects. 
We show that the classic approach of ignoring this problem potentially can have a harmful effect on the accuracy of statistics, and then consider alternatives. 
One of these is to only use independent examples, discarding other information. 
However, this is clearly suboptimal. 
We analyze sample error bounds in this networked setting, providing significantly improved results. 
An important component of our approach is formed by efficient sample weighting schemes, which leads to novel concentration inequalities.}

    title = {PAC Learning Depth-3 $\textrm{AC}^0$ Circuits of Bounded Top Fanin},
    author = {Ning Ding and Yanli Ren and Dawu Gu},
    pages = {667-680},
    abstract = {An important and long-standing question in computational learning theory is how to learn $\textrm{AC}^0$ circuits with respect to any distribution (i.e. PAC learning). All previous results either require that the underlying distribution is uniform Linial et al. (1993) (or simple variants of the uniform distribution) or restrict the depths of circuits being learned to 1 Valiant (1984) and 2 Klivans and Servedio (2004). As for the circuits of depth 3 or more, it is currently unknown how to PAC learn them.


In this paper we present an algorithm to PAC learn depth-3 $\textrm{AC}^0$ circuits of bounded top fanin over $(x_1,\cdots,x_n,\overline{x}_1,\cdots,\overline{x}_n)$. Our result is that every depth-3 $\textrm{AC}^0$ circuit of top fanin $K$ can be computed by a polynomial threshold function (PTF) of degree $\widetilde{O}(K\cdot n^{\frac{1}{2}})$, which means that it can be PAC learned in time $2^{\widetilde{O}(K\cdot n^{\frac{1}{2}})}$. In particular, when $K=O(n^{\epsilon_0})$ for any $\epsilon_0<\frac{1}{2}$, the time for learning is sub-exponential. We note that instead of employing some known tools we use some specific approximation in expressing such circuits in PTFs which can thus save a factor of $\textrm{polylog}(n)$ in degrees of the PTFs.}

    pages = {681-720},
    abstract = {Recently, much work has been done on extending the scope of online learning and incremental stochastic optimization algorithms. In this paper we contribute to this effort in two ways: First, based on a new regret decomposition and a generalization of Bregman divergences, we provide a self-contained, modular analysis of the two workhorses of online learning: (general) adaptive versions of Mirror Descent (MD) and the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithms. The analysis is done with extra care so as not to introduce assumptions not needed in the proofs and allows to combine, in a straightforward way, different algorithmic ideas (e.g., adaptivity, optimism, implicit updates) and learning settings (e.g., strongly convex or composite objectives). This way we are able to reprove, extend and refine a large body of the literature, while keeping the proofs concise.
The second contribution is a byproduct of this careful analysis: We present algorithms with improved variational bounds for smooth, composite objectives, including a new family of optimistic MD algorithms with only one projection step per round. Furthermore, we provide a simple extension of adaptive regret bounds to practically relevant non-convex problem settings with essentially no extra effort.}
