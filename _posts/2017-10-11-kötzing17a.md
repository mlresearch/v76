title: Normal Forms in Semantic Language Identification
abstract: 'We consider language learning in the limit from text where all learning
  restrictions are semantic, that is, where any conjecture may be replaced by a semantically
  equivalent conjecture. For different such learning criteria, starting with the well-known
  $\mathbfTxt\mathbfG\mathbfBc$-learning, we consider three different normal forms:
  strongly locking learning, consistent learning and (partially) set-driven learning.
  These normal forms support and simplify proofs and give insight into what behaviors
  are necessary for successful learning (for example when consistency in conservative
  learning implies cautiousness and strong decisiveness). We show that strongly locking
  learning can be assumed for partially set-driven learners, even when learning restrictions
  apply. We give a very general proof relying only on a natural property of the learning
  restriction, namely, allowing for simulation on equivalent text. Furthermore, when
  no restrictions apply, also the converse is true: every strongly locking learner
  can be made partially set-driven. For several semantic learning criteria we show
  that learning can be done consistently. Finally, we deduce for which learning restrictions
  partial set-drivenness and set-drivenness coincide, including a general statement
  about classes of infinite languages. The latter again relies on a simulation argument.'
