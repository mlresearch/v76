title: A Strongly Quasiconvex PAC-Bayesian Bound
abstract: We propose a new PAC-Bayesian bound and a way of constructing a hypothesis
  space, so that the bound is convex in the posterior distribution and also convex
  in a trade-off parameter between empirical performance of the posterior distribution
  and its complexity. The complexity is measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence
  to a prior. We derive an alternating procedure for minimizing the bound. We show
  that the bound can be rewritten as a one-dimensional function of the trade-off parameter
  and provide sufficient conditions under which the function has a single global minimum.
  When the conditions are satisfied the alternating minimization is guaranteed to
  converge to the global minimum of the bound. We provide experimental results demonstrating
  that rigorous minimization of the bound is competitive with cross-validation in
  tuning the trade-off between complexity and empirical performance. In all our experiments
  the trade-off turned to be quasiconvex even when the sufficient conditions were
  violated.
