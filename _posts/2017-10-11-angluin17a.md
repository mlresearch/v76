title: The Power of Random Counterexamples
abstract: Learning a target concept from a finite $n \times m$ concept space requires $\Omega{(n)}$ proper equivalence queries in the worst case. We propose a variation of the usual equivalence query in which the teacher is constrained to choose counterexamples randomly from a known probability distribution on examples. We present and analyze the Max-Min learning algorithm, which identifies an arbitrary target concept in an arbitrary finite $n \times m$ concept space using at most an expected $\log_2{n}$ proper equivalence queries with random counterexamples.
