title: Tight Bounds on $\ell_1$ Approximation and Learning of Self-Bounding Functions
abstract: We study the complexity of learning and approximation of self-bounding functions
  over the uniform distribution on the Boolean hypercube ${0,1}^n$. Informally, a
  function $f:{0,1}^n →\mathbbR$ is self-bounding if for every $x ∈{0,1}^n$, $f(x)$
  upper bounds the sum of all the $n$ marginal decreases in the value of the function
  at $x$. Self-bounding functions include such well-known classes of functions as
  submodular and fractionally-subadditive (XOS) functions. They were introduced by
  Boucheron \textitet al. in the context of concentration of measure inequalities.  Our
  main result is a  nearly tight $\ell_1$-approximation of self-bounding functions
  by low-degree juntas. Specifically, all self-bounding functions can be $ε$-approximated
  in $\ell_1$ by a polynomial of degree $\tildeO(1/ε)$ over $2^\tildeO(1/ε)$ variables.
  We show that both the degree and junta-size are optimal up to logarithmic terms.
  Previous techniques considered stronger $\ell_2$ approximation and proved nearly
  tight bounds of  $Θ(1/ε^2)$ on the degree and $2^Θ(1/ε^2)$ on the number of variables.
  Our bounds rely on the analysis of noise stability of self-bounding functions together
  with a stronger connection between noise stability and $\ell_1$ approximation by
  low-degree polynomials. This technique can also be used to get tighter bounds on
  $\ell_1$ approximation by low-degree polynomials and faster learning algorithm for
  halfspaces. These results lead to improved and in several cases almost tight bounds
  for PAC and agnostic learning of self-bounding functions relative to the uniform
  distribution. In particular, assuming hardness of learning juntas, we show that
  PAC and agnostic learning of self-bounding functions have complexity of $n^\tildeΘ(1/ε)$.
