title: 'Adaptive Submodularity with Varying Query Sets: An Application to Active Multi-label
  Learning'
abstract: Adaptive submodular optimization, where a sequence of items is selected  adaptively
  to optimize a submodular function, has been found to have  many applications from
  sensor placement to active learning. In the  current paper, we extend this work
  to the setting of multiple queries at  each time step, where the set of available
  queries is randomly constrained.  A primary contribution of this paper is to prove
  the first near optimal  approximation bound for a greedy policy in this setting.  A
  natural application of this framework is to crowd-sourced active learning   problem
  where the set of available experts and examples might vary randomly.  We instantiate  the
  new framework for multi-label learning and evaluate it in multiple  benchmark domains
  with promising results.
