title: Dealing with Range Anxiety in Mean Estimation via Statistical Queries
abstract: We give algorithms for estimating the expectation of a given real-valued function $\phi:X\to \mathbb{R}$ on a sample drawn randomly from some unknown distribution $D$ over domain $X$, namely $\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D}[\phi(\mathbf{x})]$. Our algorithms work in two well-studied models of restricted access to data samples. The first one is the statistical query (SQ) model in which an algorithm has access to an {\em SQ oracle} for the input distribution $D$ over $X$ instead of i.i.d.~samples from $D$. Given a query function $\phi:X \to [0,1]$, the oracle returns an estimate of $\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D}[\phi(\mathbf{x})]$ within some tolerance $\tau$. The second, is a  model in which only a single bit is communicated from each sample. In both of these models the error obtained using a naive implementation would scale polynomially with the range of the random variable $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ (which might even be infinite). In contrast, without restrictions on access to data the expected error scales with the standard deviation of $\phi(\mathbf{x})$. Here we give a simple algorithm whose error scales linearly in standard deviation of $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ and logarithmically with an upper bound on the second moment of $\phi(\mathbf{x})$. \newline As corollaries, we obtain algorithms for high dimensional mean estimation and stochastic convex optimization in these models that work in more general settings than previously known solutions.
