title: Specifying a positive threshold function via extremal points
abstract: An extremal point of a positive threshold Boolean function $f$ is either
  a maximal zero or a minimal one. It is known that if $f$ depends on all its variables,
  then the set of its extremal points completely specifies $f$ within the universe  of
  threshold functions. However, in some cases, $f$ can be specified by a smaller set.
  The minimum number of  points in such a set is the specification number of $f$.  Hu (1965)
  showed that the specification number of a threshold function of $n$ variables is
  at least $n+1$.   Anthony et al. (1995) proved that this bound is attained for nested
  functions and conjectured that for all other threshold functions the specification
  number is strictly greater than $n+1$. In the present paper, we resolve this conjecture
  negatively by  exhibiting threshold Boolean functions of $n$ variables, which are
  non-nested and  for which the specification number is $n+1$. On the other hand,
  we show that the set of extremal points satisfies  the statement of the conjecture,
  i.e. a positive threshold Boolean function depending on all its $n$ variables has
  $n+1$ extremal points if and only if it is nested. To prove this, we reveal an underlying
  structure of the set of extremal points.
