title: An efficient query learning algorithm for zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams
abstract: A ZDD is a directed acyclic graph that represents a family of sets over
  a fixed universe set. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that learns zero-suppressed
  binary decision diagrams (ZDDs)  using membership and equivalence queries. If the
  target ZDD has $n$ nodes and the cardinality of the universe is $m$, our algorithm
  uses $n$ equivalence queries and at most $n(⌊\log m ⌋+ 4n)$ membership queries to
  learn the target ZDD.
