title: 'On Compressive Ensemble Induced Regularisation: How Close is the Finite Ensemble
  Precision Matrix to the Infinite Ensemble?'
abstract: Averaging ensembles of randomly oriented low-dimensional projections of
  a singular covariance represent a novel and attractive means to obtain a well-conditioned
  inverse, which only needs access to random projections of the data. However, theoretical
  analyses so far have only been done at convergence, implying good properties for
  ‘large-enough’ ensembles. But how large is ‘large enough’? Here we bound the expected
  difference in spectral norm between the finite ensemble precision matrix and the
  infinite ensemble, and based on this we give an estimate of the required ensemble
  size to guarantee the approximation error of the finite ensemble is below a given
  tolerance. Under mild assumptions, we find that for any given tolerance, the ensemble
  only needs to grow linearly in the original data dimension.  A technical ingredient
  of our analysis is to upper bound the spectral norm of a matrix-variate T,  which
  we then  employ in conjunction with specific results from random matrix theory regarding
  the estimation of the covariance of random matrices.
