title: Learning MSO-definable hypotheses on strings
abstract: We study the classification problems over string data for hypotheses specified
  by formulas of monadic second-order logic MSO. The goal is to design learning algorithms
  that run in time polynomial in the size of the training set, independently of or
  at least sublinear in the size of the whole data set. We prove negative as well
  as positive results. If the data set is an unprocessed string to which our algorithms
  have local access, then learning in sublinear time is impossible even for hypotheses
  definable in a small fragment of first-order logic. If we allow for a linear time
  pre-processing of the string data to build an index data structure, then learning
  of MSO-definable hypotheses is possible in time polynomial in the size of the training
  set, independently of the size of the whole data set.
