title: Preference-based Teaching of Unions of Geometric Objects
abstract: This paper studies exact learning of unions of non-discretized  geometric
  concepts in the model of preference-based teaching.  In particular, it focuses on
  upper and lower bounds of the  corresponding sample complexity parameter, the preference-based  teaching
  dimension (PBTD), when learning disjoint unions of a  bounded number of geometric
  concepts of various types – for  instance balls, axis-aligned cubes, or axis-aligned
  boxes – in arbitrary dimensions. It is shown that the PBTD of disjoint  unions of
  some such types of concepts grows linearly with the  number of concepts in the union,
  independent of the dimensionality.  Teaching the union of potentially overlapping
  objects turns out  to be more involved and is hence considered here only for unions  of
  up to two objects.
