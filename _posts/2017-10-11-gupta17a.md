title: Parameter identification in Markov chain choice models
abstract: This work studies the parameter identification problem for the Markov chain
  choice model of Blanchet, Gallego, and Goyal used in assortment planning.  In this
  model, the product selected by a customer is determined by a Markov chain over the
  products, where the products in the offered assortment are absorbing states.  The
  underlying parameters of the model were previously shown to be identifiable from
  the choice probabilities for the all-products assortment, together with choice probabilities
  for assortments of all-but-one products.  Obtaining and estimating choice probabilities
  for such large assortments is not desirable in many settings.  The main result of
  this work is that the parameters may be identified from assortments of sizes two
  and three, regardless of the total number of products.  The result is obtained via
  a simple and efficient parameter recovery algorithm.
