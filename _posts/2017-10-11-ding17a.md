title: PAC Learning Depth-3 $\textrmAC^0$ Circuits of Bounded Top Fanin
abstract: An important and long-standing question in computational learning theory
  is how to learn $\textrmAC^0$ circuits with respect to any distribution (i.e. PAC
  learning). All previous results either require that the underlying distribution
  is uniform Linial et al. (1993) (or simple variants of the uniform distribution)
  or restrict the depths of circuits being learned to 1 Valiant (1984) and 2 Klivans
  and Servedio (2004). As for the circuits of depth 3 or more, it is currently unknown
  how to PAC learn them. In this paper we present an algorithm to PAC learn depth-3
  $\textrmAC^0$ circuits of bounded top fanin over $(x_1,⋯,x_n,\overlinex_1,⋯,\overlinex_n)$.
  Our result is that every depth-3 $\textrmAC^0$ circuit of top fanin $K$ can be computed
  by a polynomial threshold function (PTF) of degree $\widetildeO(K⋅n^\frac12)$, which
  means that it can be PAC learned in time $2^\widetildeO(K⋅n^\frac12)$. In particular,
  when $K=O(n^\epsilon_0)$ for any $\epsilon_0<\frac12$, the time for learning is
  sub-exponential. We note that instead of employing some known tools we use some
  specific approximation in expressing such circuits in PTFs which can thus save a
  factor of $\textrmpolylog(n)$ in degrees of the PTFs.
