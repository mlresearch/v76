title: 'A Modular Analysis of Adaptive (Non-)Convex Optimization: Optimism, Composite
  Objectives, and Variational Bounds'
abstract: 'Recently, much work has been done on extending the scope of online learning
  and incremental stochastic optimization algorithms. In this paper we contribute
  to this effort in two ways: First, based on a new regret decomposition and a generalization
  of Bregman divergences, we provide a self-contained, modular analysis of the two
  workhorses of online learning: (general) adaptive versions of Mirror Descent (MD)
  and the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithms. The analysis is done with
  extra care so as not to introduce assumptions not needed in the proofs and allows
  to combine, in a straightforward way, different algorithmic ideas (e.g., adaptivity,
  optimism, implicit updates) and learning settings (e.g., strongly convex or composite
  objectives). This way we are able to reprove, extend and refine a large body of
  the literature, while keeping the proofs concise. The second contribution is a byproduct
  of this careful analysis: We present algorithms with improved variational bounds
  for smooth, composite objectives, including a new family of optimistic MD algorithms
  with only one projection step per round. Furthermore, we provide a simple extension
  of adaptive regret bounds to practically relevant non-convex problem settings with
  essentially no extra effort.'
